summary: A little game about a dog that is trying to make friends.
description: |
  Play as a little that chases around people and dogs. If you you manage to touch one of them he 
  will become your friend, but if one of your friends touches a stranger he will become a 
  stranger again. Once all the people and dogs in a level are your friends you progress to the 
  next level. Each level has one more people and dogs than the previous level, and it can quickly 
  become quite hectic.
